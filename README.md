## The project

This Git Repository is the repository for the project of Data Engineering II.

We had to create an application that can analyse a sentence and return if the sentence is positive, negative or neutral.

It is divided in 4 branches : the main branch, the branch with the code for the website, the branch with the code for the sentiment analysis and finally a branch for the testes.

## Task Management
We used Trello for the project management. We define three list : to do, in progress, done.

## Tests

To run test file, you have to open a terminal and go to the Website folder (path : DE_Project\Website).
Then you can execute the following command : python -m pytest
