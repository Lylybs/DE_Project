This Git Repository is the repository for the project of Data Engineering II.

We had to create an application that can analyse a sentence and return if the sentence is positive, negative or neutral.

It is divided in 4 branches : the main branch, the branch with the code for the website, the branch with the code for the sentiment analysis and finally a branch for the testes.
